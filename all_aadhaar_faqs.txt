The data will be secured with the best encryption, and in a highly secure data vault. All access details will be properly logged.

Q73: What are the common issues seen with Indian Language Input?keyboard_arrow_down
A73: The most common problem that UIDAI have seen is with installation of the IME, and it’s interactions with the language bar. Further, it is possible to configure the Windows language input to assume a local language keyboard. This is not the same as transliteration, but assumes a different keyboard is being used – and the results are very different. UIDAI have also had difficulty in truly transliterating English words into local language, as they are very different from the language model. This can be better handled by using advanced facilities in the IMEs (for ex. Schemes in Google IME) The language support must be configured on a per user basis, and that makes it harder to manage.

Similarly, a female enrollee may tell her name as K. S. K. Durga while her full name may be Kalluri Surya Kanaka Durga. Ascertain from her/him the expansion of her/his initials and check the same in the documentary evidence produced. If two documentary proofs produced by the enrollee have variation in the same name (i.e., with initials and full name), the enrollee’s full name should be recorded. Sometimes the infants and children may not have been named yet. Try to ascertain the intended name for the child by explaining to the enrollee the importance of capturing the name of the individual for allotting UID. Proof of Date of Birth(PDB)): Date of birth of individual seeking to enrol/update must indicate day, month and year in the relevant field. If the individual seeking to enrol/update provides documentary evidence of Date of Birth, then the Date of Birth is considered as “Verified”. When individual seeking to enrol/update declares the DoB without any documentary evidence, then date of birth is considered as “Declared”. When the individual seeking to enrol/update is unable to give exact date of birth and only age is mentioned by the individual seeking to enrol/update or approximated by the verifier then only age is recorded. The software will automatically calculate year of birth in such case. The Verifier should check the entry in the Enrolment/Update Form and ensure that the individual seeking to enrol/update has correctly indicated the date of birth as “verified”/”declared” or has filled his/her Age. Residential Address: Verify that the PoA contains the name and address. The Verifier should ensure that the name in the PoA document matches with the name in the PoI document. A difference in the name in PoI and PoA document is acceptable if the difference is only in spelling and/or sequence of first, middle and last name. The “care of” person’s name, if any, is usually captured for children and old age people living with parents and children, respectively. If not available, one can leave this Address line blank (as its optional). Enhancement of address is allowed. The individual seeking to enrol/update may be allowed to add minor fields such as House No., Lane No., Street Name, correcting typographic errors, minor changes/ corrections to pin code etc. to the address listed in the PoA as long as these additions/modifications do not alter the base address mentioned in the PoA document If the changes requested in Address Enhancement are substantial and change the base address that is listed in the PoA, the individual seeking to enrol/update will be required to produce an alternate PoA. Relationship Details: In the case of children below 5 years, “Name” and “Aadhaar Number” of one of the parents or guardian is mandatory. Parent/Legal Guardian must produce their Aadhaar letter when enrolling children (or they can be Enroled together). In the case of an adult, no verification will be done for the information on parent or spouse. They are recorded for internal purposes only. Head of Family(HoF): Verify that the PoR document establishes relation between the Head of Family and the family member. Only those family members can be Enroled based on the relationship document (PoR), whose names are recorded on relationship document. Head of Family must always accompany the family member when the family member is getting Enroled. The verifier must also check the HoF details in the Enrolment/ Update Form in case of HoF based verification. HoF’s Name and Aadhaar Number in form should be verified against the Aadhaar letter. Ensure that in case of HoF based enrolments, the relationship details mentioned in the form are of the HoF only. Mobile Number, Email address: If the enrollee possesses and is willing to provide his/her Mobile Number and / or Email Address, these optional fields must be filled in. Verifier can inform the importance of these fields to the individual seeking to enrol/update .

Q96: What are the responsibilities of a Verifier?keyboard_arrow_down
A96: For enrolment, applicant will bring his/her Original documents/ Attested Photocopies along with filled Aadhaar Enrolment/Update Form. Verifier must verify the information mentioned in the supporting documents with the information mentioned in the Aadhaar Enrolment/Update Form. Verifier also checks that the names of the documents captured in the enrolment form are correct and same as the original documents produced by the applicant Verifier’s needs to ensure that Enrolment/Update Form is filled completely and correctly as per UIDAI enrolment process. No mandatory field should be left blank and applicants should be encouraged to fill optional fields like mobile number and email address. Verifier will sign and stamp the Enrolment/Update Form after verification. If stamp is not available, the verifier can sign and put his/her Name. The individual seeking to enrol will then go to the Enrolment Agency Operator for getting Enroled. However, if the Aadhaar number holder is Enroled and has come for Correction for a particular demographic field, the applicant need not enter all details in the Form. The Aadhaar number holder must provide his/her original Enrolment Number, Date and Time (together known as EID)/UID/, his/her Name and the field which needs correction. Verifier will only verify if it is one of the fields requiring verification of documents. Verifier will use the same UIDAI verification guidelines as used during applicant enrolment. The Verifier must be physically present at the enrolment centre, and monitor the Enrolment Centre performance and provide immediate information to UIDAI and Registrar on process deviations and malpractices at the enrolment centre.

Q98: What are the Document Scanning Guidelines of UIDAI?keyboard_arrow_down
A98: The Operator will scan Originals of each of the documents below depending on the type of enrolment: Enrolment Form – For each Enrolment PoI, PoA – For document based enrolments Proof of Date of Birth (PDB) document – For Verified Date of Birth PoR – For Head of Family Based Enrolments Acknowledgement cum Consent – For each Enrolment after Operator and Applicant's signature The documents are scanned in a sequence and all document scans are standard size (A4). Make sure that the desired portions (the data entered during Aadhaar enrolment) of the document are visible clearly in the scan and the document pages do not overlap. Each scanned page must be legible and without any marks due to dust and scratches. Remove the previous scan and re- scan a document where required. Once all document pages are scanned, the Operator can see and check the total no. of pages scanned and confirm that all pages are scanned. Return all the original documents and Enrolment Form to the applicant Also handover the acknowledgement cum Consent to the applicant.

Q99: What Does the Operator do after Capturing Demographic and Biometric Data of the applicant?keyboard_arrow_down
A99: The Operator will then authenticate himself/ herself to sign-off the data captured for the applicant. Do not allow anyone else to sign for an enrolment that you have done. Do not sign for enrolments done by others. Operator will get the Supervisor to Sign Off in case enrolee has biometric exceptions In case the verification type is selected as HOF, get the HOF authentication. Operator can select the local language of the region, if required he may change language for Language only update requests. Take Applicant's signature on consent and file the same along with applicant's other documents. Sign and Provide Acknowledgement to applicant The acknowledgement is a written confirmation of the applicant getting Enroled. It is important for the applicant as it carries the enrolment number, date and time that the applicant will need to quote when interacting with UIDAI and its Contact centre (1947) for information on his/her Aadhaar status. The enrolment number, date and time are also required if any correction in the applicant's data is required to be done using update process. Thus the operator must make sure that the acknowledgement and consent printed is clear and legible. While handing over the acknowledgement to the applicant the Operator must inform below to the applicant. The Enrolment Number printed on acknowledgement is not the Aadhaar number and that the applicant's Aadhaar number will be communicated through a letter subsequently. This message is also printed in acknowledgement. The applicant must preserve his/her and the children’s Enrolment Acknowledgement Slip for future reference. To know the Aadhaar Generation Status they can call the Call Centre or log on to e-Aadhaar portal/Aadhaar Portal/website. Aadhaar number will be delivered by the local post office to the address provided at the time of enrolment.

Q101: What are the UIDAI Guidelines for Biometric Data Capture?keyboard_arrow_down
A101: Biometric Data Capture Guidelines: Check applicant's eyes and fingers for fitness (missing/amputated). If the applicant has any deformities due to which it is not possible to take fingerprints/iris, these also have to be captured as a biometric exception. Check and indicate Biometric Exceptions in the software, only where applicable. Do not mark biometric exceptions where biometrics can be captured. It will be treated as ‘fraud’ and invite strictest penalty. In case of Biometric exception, always take the Exception photograph of the applicant showing individual’s seeking to enrol/update face and both hands, irrespective of the type of exception. The enrolee may not be in a position to keep herself / himself in correct posture for reaching biometric instruments or for photograph due to old age or sickness. In such cases the operator should arrange to take the biometric data by moving the equipment close to the enrole. If the finger/iris of the applicant has a temporary damage and it is not possible to capture the biometric, the applicant should come later once temporary damage is resolved. Capture Biometrics - Facial Image, IRIS and Fingerprints for all the applicants above 5 years in age. In case of children who are below 5 years in age, only Facial Image and authentication by one of the parent’s/legal guardian is to be captured. Guidelines for Facial Image Capture Enrolee Position: For capturing facial image, it is advisable for the operator to adjust the camera instead of the Enrole to position herself/himself at the right distance or in the right posture. Frontal pose needs to be captured i.e. no head rotation or tilt. The applicant should be instructed to be seated properly with their back upright and their face towards the camera. Focus: The capture device should use auto focus and auto-capture functions. The output image should not suffer from motion blur, over or under exposure, unnatural colored lighting, and distortion. Expression: Expression strongly affects the performance of automatic face recognition and also affects accurate visual inspection by humans. It is strongly recommended that the face should be captured with neutral (non-smiling) expression, teeth closed, and both eyes open and looking into the camera. Illumination: Poor illumination has a high impact on the performance of face recognition. Proper and equally distributed lighting mechanism should be used such that there are no shadows over the face, no shadows in eye sockets, and no hot spots. No light exactly above the enrolee should be used since it can cause shadows. Light should be diffused and placed in front of the enrolee so that there are no shadows under the eye. Eye Glasses: glasses should be taken off before taking the photograph. Accessories: Use of accessories that cover any region of the face is not permitted. For example, women in purdah would have to reveal the full face before the photograph is taken. Similarly women in Ghoonghat would have to clearly reveal the full face before the photograph can be captured. The head may remain covered but the full face contour should be visible. Further, accessories like turban/head gear are also allowed as religious/ traditional practices. However, accessories like eye patches are allowed due to medical reasons. This would also mean an exception needs to be recorded for Iris, because only one Iris can be captured. Operators need to be trained to obtain the best possible face images that satisfy requirements. Even if the quality flag is green but the Operator is able to judge that a better picture can be taken, then same should be attempted. However, it should be borne in mind that recapture should not become harassment for the applicant. For children, it is acceptable that the child sits on parent’s laps, but it needs to be ensured that parent’s face is not captured along with child’s face. The background may get rejected due to non white screen in case of children but two faces should not get captured in one picture. Actionable feedback needs to be checked for captures that fail. Some of the actionable feedbacks in software are: No face Found Enrolee too far Enrolee too close (eye distance in input image is greater than one third of image width) Pose (Look Straight) Insufficient lighting Very low face confidence (faceless, object not identified as human face) Non-uniform lighting (of face in output image) Incorrect background (in output image) Insufficient lighting (bad gray values in face area of output image) If any biometric exceptions have been specified on the demographic screen, these should be captured as photographs on the Photograph screen. Only facial image is captured for children below 5 years. Iris and fingerprint screens will not get activated for children below 5 years Guidelines for Capturing Fingerprints The images of all the ten fingers are to be captured. The fingerprints must be captured in the sequence of slaps of four fingers of left hand, right hand followed by the two thumbs. The fingers have to be positioned correctly on the platen to enable capture. There should be no direct light shining on the platen. Use the Indicators on fingerprint devices for positioning of fingers. The fingers should be placed in right direction on the device. Please consult the manufacturer manual incase of any doubt or else consult the supervisor. Use a lint free cloth periodically to clean the platen of the finger print device for good finger print capture Check devices periodically for scratches, out of focus images, only partial images getting captured. In case any such problem is noticed, then report to your Supervisor/EA and request for change of equipment. Fingerprints cut off, wet/smudged fingerprint; very light prints due to insufficient pressure will result in poor quality. The applicant's hands should be clean (no mud, oil etc.). Ask applicant to wash hands with water and soap, if necessary. The fingers should not be excessively dry or wet. Moisten with a wet cloth or dry finger with a dry cloth The Enrollee should be requested to place all four fingers of the left hand/right hand/two thumbs to platen of the fingerprint scanner for the four-finger capture to ensure good contact and maximize the area of the captured fingerprints. Ensure that the fingers are placed flat and till the top joint of the finger is placed well on the scanner. The top of the fingers should be within the platen area and not outside the defined area. If automatic capture does not happen, the operator should force the capture when force capture tab is enabled in the enrolment software. The operator should check the actionable feedback when capture fails. Some actionable feedbacks provided by software are: Number of fingers present does not match with expected number of fingers Finger not positioned correctly Too much Pressure (duty cycle) Too little pressure Central region missing Excessive moisture (wetness) Excessive dryness The operator should visually check the image for quality and for typical problems. In case there are problems go back to steps above to retry the capture. When image quality is pass or if maximum number of captures are exhausted, move on to the next step Fingerprints are best captured in standing position In case of additional fingers, ignore the additional finger and capture the main five fingers. Make sure your own fingerprints do not get mixed with the applicant's fingerprints. Operators can carefully put small pressure on the applicant's fingers to capture the fingerprints but always make sure not to mix your own fingerprints. Guidelines for Capturing Iris The operator and not the Enrollee will handle the capture device, generally. Children can be told that it is like taking photos/pictures so that they are not apprehensive. The Enrollee will be required to sit in a fixed position, like taking a portrait photograph. The software is able to measure the iris image quality. An initial image quality assessment would be done to provide feedback to the operator during the capture process. The software alerts the operator with actionable feedbacks, if the captured iris image is of insufficient quality. Some actionable feedbacks provided by software are: Occlusion(significant part of iris is not visible) Iris not in focus Gaze incorrect( individual seeking to enrol/update looking away) Pupil dilation The iris capture process is sensitive to ambient light. No direct or artificial light should directly reflect off Enrolee’s eyes. The device should be held steady. In case device requires to be held by individual seeking to enrol/update , the enrolment operator/supervisor may help the applicant to hold the device steady. Table light used for facial image capture should be switched off during iris capture. Direct sunlight or any other bright light shining on applicant's eye will create reflections and result in poor quality image. Operator must instruct the applicant to look straight into the iris scanner, open eyes wide open (one easy way to do this is to ask the applicant look angry or stare) and do not blink during iris capture. Applicant has to be stationary. If applicant is experiencing difficulty during Iris scan and recapture is required, then the operator may navigate to next screen to capture other details and then return to Iris capture. This will relax the applicant from constant pressure to keep eyes wide open during iris capture. The Operator needs to be patient during capture and wait for the device response instead of scrolling, navigating back and forth on screen.

Q102: What are the UIDAI Guidelines for Demographic Data Capture?keyboard_arrow_down
A102: Demographic Data Capture Guidelines: Enter the Demographic details of the applicant from the verified Enrolment/Update Form. In case of Aadhaar Update, only the fields which need to be updated should be marked and filled. Encourage the applicant to add mobile number and email ID in the form. Pay attention to Data Aesthetics during demographic data capture. Avoid improper use of spaces, punctuation marks, capital & small letters during data capture. Avoid use of un-parliamentary language & transliteration error. Leave those non-mandatory fields blank where no data is provided by applicant. Do not enter N/A, NA etc. in fields where applicant has not provided any data. FillingC/o field with Father / Mother / Husband / Wife / Guardian field is not mandatory for applicant. In case of children below the age of 5 years the parents’ or legal guardian’s name and Aadhaar Number shall be mandatorily recorded. It is not compulsory for only father’s name to be recorded against the ‘parent’s name.’ Mother’s name can alone be recorded for the ‘parent’s guardian’s’ name if so desired by the parent. Enrolment of the parent is mandatory prior to the child. If the child’s father /mother / guardian has not Enroled or does not possess Aadhaar Number at the time of enrolment, the enrolment of that child cannot be done. For Head of Family (HoF) based verification Name, Aadhaar Number of HoF and Relationship Details of the family member to HoF are mandatory details to be entered.

Q106: Who is a Registrar?keyboard_arrow_down
A106: "Registrar" is any entity authorized or recognized by the UID Authority for the purpose of enrolling the individuals for UID numbers. Registrars are typically departments or agencies of the State Government/Union territory, public sector undertakings and other agencies and organizations, who interact with individual s in the normal course of implementation of some of their programs, activities or operations. Examples of such Registrars are Rural Development Department (for NREGS) or Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department (for TPDS), insurance companies such as Life Insurance Corporation and Banks. Registrars will collect demographic & biometric data from individuals directly or through Enrolment Agencies. Registrars have the flexibility to collect additional data, which will be referred to as ‘KYR+’ fields for the various applications they have in mind. The UIDAI has developed standards, procedures and processes, guidelines and technology systems to execute the entire Aadhaar enrolment process which will be adhered to by the Registrars. Registrars can also leverage the Ecosystem that has been built by the UIDAI in order to support them in this process.

Q273: How does the UIDAI protect the individual and their information?keyboard_arrow_down
A273: Protection of the individual, and the safeguarding their information is inherent in the design of the UID project. From having a random number which does not reveal anything about the individual to other features listed below, the UID project keeps the interest of the individual at the core of its purpose and objectives. Collecting limited information: Data collected by the UIDAI is purely to issue Aadhaar, and confirm the identity of Aadhaar holders. The UIDAI is collecting basic data fields in order to be able to establish identity this includes Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Parent/ Guardian's name essential for children but not for others, mobile number and email id is optional as well . The UIDAI is collecting biometric information to establish uniqueness therefore collecting photo, 10 finger prints and iris. No profiling and tracking information collected: The UIDAI policy bars it from collecting sensitive personal information such as religion, caste, community, class, ethnicity, income and health. The profiling of individuals is therefore not possible through the UID system, since the data collected is limited to that required for identification and identity confirmation. The UIDAI had in fact, dropped the place of birth data field part of the initial list of information it planned to collect based on feedback from CSOs that it could lead to profiling. The UIDAI also does not collect any transaction records of the individual. The records of an individual confirming their identity through Aadhaar will only reflect that such a confirmation happened. This limited information will be retained for a short period time in the interest of the individual , to resolve any disputes. Release of information - yes or no response: The UIDAI is barred from revealing personal information in Aadhaar database the only response permitted is yes or no to requests to verify an identity The only exceptions are the order of a High court , or the order of a secretary, in case of national security . This is a reasonable exception and is clear and precise. This approach is also in line with security norms followed in US and Europe on access to data in case of a security threat. Data protection and privacy: The UIDAI has the obligation to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data collected . The data will be collected on software provided by the UIDAI and encrypted to prevent leaks in transit. Trained and certified enrollers will collect the information, who will not have access to the data being collected. The UIDAI has a comprehensive security policy to ensure the safety and integrity of its data. It will publish more details on this, including the Information Security Plan and Policies for the CIDR and mechanisms for auditing the compliance of the UIDAI and its contracting agencies. In addition, there will be strict security and storage protocols in place. Penalties for any security violation will be severe, and include penalties for disclosing identity information . There are penal consequences for unauthorised access to CIDR including hacking , and penalties for tampering with data in the CIDR under the Aadhaar Act, 2016 . Convergence and linking of UIDAI information to other databases: The UID database is not linked to any other databases, or to information held in other databases. Its only purpose will be to verify a person's identity at the point of receiving a service, and that too with the consent of Aadhaar holder. The UID database will be guarded both physically and electronically by a few select individuals with high clearance. It will not be available even for many members of the UID staff and will be secured with the best encryption, and in a highly secure data vault. All access details will be properly logged.

Electronic benefit transfers: The UID-enabled-Bank-Account network will offer a secure and low cost platform to directly remit benefits to Aadhaar number holders without the heavy costs associated today with benefit distribution; the leakages in the current system will also be stemmed as a result. Aadhaar-based authentication to confirm entitlement delivered to the beneficiary: The UIDAI will offer online authentication services for agencies who wish to validate a A adhaar number holder 's identity; this service will enable confirmation of the entitlement actually reaching the intended beneficiary. Improved services through increased transparency: Clear accountability and transparent monitoring would significantly improve access and quality of entitlements to beneficiaries and the agency alike. Self-service puts A adhaar number holders in control : Using Aadhaar as an authentication mechanism, A adhaar number holder s should be able to access up-to-date information about their entitlements, demand services and redress their grievances directly from their mobile phone, kiosks or other means. In the case of self-service on the A adhaar number holder 's mobile, security is assured using two-factor authentication (i.e. by proving possession of the A adhaar number holder 's registered Mobile Number and knowledge of the A adhaar number holder 's Aadhaar PIN). These standards are compliant with the Reserve Bank of India's approved standards for Mobile Banking and Payments.

Q375: Can a individual opt out of Aadhaar?keyboard_arrow_down
A375: The individual has the option in the first instance not to enrol for Aadhaar at all. Aadhaar is a service delivery tool, and not designed for any other purpose. Aadhaar being unique to every individual is non-transferable. If the individual does not wish to use the Aadhaar, it will remain dormant, as the use is based on the physical presence and biometric authentication of the person. However, children, within 6 months of attaining majority, may make an application for cancellation of their Aadhaar as per the provisions of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 (as amended) and regulations framed there under.

Q378: How does the UIDAI protect the individual and their information?keyboard_arrow_down
A378: Protection of the individual, and the safeguarding their information is inherent in the design of the UID project. From having a random number which does not reveal anything about the individual to other features listed below, the UID project keeps the interest of the individual at the core of its purpose and objectives. Collecting limited information Data collected by the UIDAI is purely to issue Aadhaar numbers, and confirm the identity of Aadhaar number holders. The UIDAI is collecting basic data fields in order to be able to establish identity– this includes Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Parent/ Guardian’s name essential for children but not for others, mobile number and email id is optional as well . The UIDAI is collecting biometric information to establish uniqueness – therefore collecting photo, 10 finger prints and iris. No profiling and tracking information collected The UIDAI policy bars it from collecting sensitive personal information such as religion, caste, community, class, ethnicity, income and health. The profiling of individuals is therefore not possible through the UID system, since the data collected is limited to that required for identification and identity confirmation. The UIDAI had in fact, dropped the ‘place of birth’ data field – part of the initial list of information it planned to collect – based on feedback from CSOs that it could lead to profiling. The UIDAI also does not collect any transaction records of the individual. The records of an individual confirming their identity through Aadhaar will only reflect that such a confirmation happened. This limited information will be retained for a short period time in the interest of the individual, to resolve any disputes. Release of information – yes or no response The UIDAI is barred from revealing personal information in the Aadhaar database – the only response permitted are a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to requests to verify an identity. The only exceptions are the order of a court, or the order of a joint secretary, in case of national security. This is a reasonable exception and is clear and precise. This approach is also in line with security norms followed in US and Europe on access to data in case of a security threat. Data protection and privacy The UIDAI has the obligation to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data collected. The data will be collected on software provided by the UIDAI and encrypted to prevent leaks in transit. Trained and certified enrollers will collect the information, which will not have access to the data being collected. The UIDAI has a comprehensive security policy to ensure the safety and integrity of its data. It will publish more details on this, including the Information Security Plan and Policies for the CIDR and mechanisms for auditing the compliance of the UIDAI and its contracting agencies. In addition, there will be strict security and storage protocols in place. Penalties for any security violation will be severe, and include penalties for disclosing identity information. There will also be penal consequences for unauthorised access to CIDR – including hacking, and penalties for tampering with data in the CIDR. Convergence and linking of UIDAI information to other databases The UID database is not linked to any other databases, or to information held in other databases. Its only purpose will be to verify a person’s identity at the point of receiving a service, and that too with the consent of the aadhaar number holder. The UID database will be guarded both physically and electronically by a few select individuals with high clearance. It will not be available even for many members of the UID staff and will be secured with the best encryption, and in a highly secure data vault. All access details will be properly logged.
